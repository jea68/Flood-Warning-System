# CUED Part IA Flood Warning System

## Summary
Built a computational backend (library) for real-time flood warning systems in England. The library does the following:

- Fetch real-time river-level data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs data service.
- Support specified data query types on river-level monitoring stations.
- Analyse monitoring station data to assess flood risks and issue flood warnings for areas of the country.
- The system is to be built on the (near) real-time river level data at the nearly 2000 monitoring stations that are made available by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
- Data is fetched from https://environment.data.gov.uk/ using a REST interface.

The activity is documented at https://cued-partia-flood-warning.readthedocs.io/.
